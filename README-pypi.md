# d2vg

d2vg, a Doc2Vec grep.

Use the Doc2Vec model to search for document files that contain parts similar to (but not necessarily including the same words as) the query phrase.

* Supports searching within text files (.txt), PDF files (.pdf), and MS Word files (.docx)
* Supported languages are English and Japanese, in addition to experimental support languages: Chinese, Korean.
* Performance gain by indexing

Since it is not pure python, it cannot be installed by pip alone. Please refer to [the instructions](https://github.com/tos-kamiya/d2vg#installation) on the homepage.
